# ECE102-Team3
This is the matlab github page for the ECE102 project code
This project details a home security system using a serial button input. The serial button uses a clock pulse of around 6kHz to scan through
a remote control. We accomplish this using ttl logic.

The code is comprised of a main, a remote handler and an alarm system. The main is controled by the remote.

Enjoy!
